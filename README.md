Hello everyone! My name is Henry and I'm a Web Developer currently working on refining my Full-Stack skills.
In a very broad sense, I'm interested in how technology will be evolving in the next 5 years. A year ago today we 
entered a new phase in the growth of technology where we had to rapidly adapt to our new circumstances of confinement. 
In response, many companies had to smake a full switch to online methods of  sales and marketing, and I believe that it is 
necessary for developers to lead the way on this. 

Lets collaborate, what do you think we can do as developers to help this advance in technology? Shoot me an email here
