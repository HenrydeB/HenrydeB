Hello everyone! My name is Henry and I am a graduate student at DePaul University working on my M.S. in Software Engineering with a concentration in Software Architecture. I started out self taught with the MERN stack, but have been working to refine my skills to get better at Java and TypeScript, but am not opposed to picking up a new language for the right project.

Currently I am seeking internships or opportunities where I can actively apply my knowledge and refine my craft. If you have a project you could use a collaborator on, let me know, I'd love to see what I can do. 

Lets collaborate, what do you think we can do as developers to help this advance in technology? Drop a DM here, can't wait to hear from you.
